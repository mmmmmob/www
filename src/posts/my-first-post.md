Hello! This is a placeholder **first** post written in Markdown. Change _draft_ to `false` or delete it entirely to start publishing your first post.

If you don't want to add custom image for Open Graph preview, just delete _image_ field. OG API will auto generate from post title.

But if you have your own, just add a file to `/public/og` folder and paste a raw filename here.
